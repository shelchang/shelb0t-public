# shelb0t-public
Public version of shelb0t, the Federal Hotdog Committee discord.py bot

If running on a new setup, install required packages using:  
pip install -U discord.py  
pip install asyncio  
pip install numpy  

# Setting up the bot for your team/server
Set up roster.txt with the steamID64's of each team member (17 digit ID number), one per line. The bot will get logs/demos from the last 24 hours in which 4 or more team members show up, which allows for up to 2 ringers/subs.

Also set up the bot token and channel IDs for your bot/server on lines 23 and 26.
